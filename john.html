<p>Mercedes-AMG GmbH, commonly known as AMG (Aufrecht, Melcher, Gro�aspach), is the high-performance subsidiary of Mercedes-Benz AG.[1] AMG independently hires engineers and contracts with manufacturers to customize Mercedes-Benz AMG vehicles. The company has its headquarters in Affalterbach, Baden-W�rttemberg, Germany.</p>
<br>
<p>AMG was originally an independent engineering firm specializing in performance improvements for Mercedes-Benz vehicles. DaimlerChrysler AG took a controlling interest in 1999, then became the sole owner of AMG in 2005. Mercedes-AMG GmbH is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Mercedes-Benz AG,[1] which is in turn owned by the Mercedes-Benz Group.</p>
<br>
<p>AMG models typically have more aggressive looks, higher performance, better handling, better stability and more carbon fibre than their regular Mercedes-Benz counterparts. AMG models are typically the most expensive and highest-performing variant of each Mercedes-Benz class.[3] AMG has also made special variants of some Mitsubishi and Honda models.</p>
